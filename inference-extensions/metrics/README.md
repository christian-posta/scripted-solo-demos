Create a grafana dashboard with the following

export GRAFANA_URL=http://localhost:3000
python dashboard_generator.py --grafana-url $GRAFANA_URL --api-key $GRAFANA_API_KEY


To add Envoy Gateway specific dashboards (for now while, we have EG under the covers; this will be removed soon)
https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway/blob/main/charts/gateway-addons-helm/dashboards/

Creating a Grafana API Key:

Go to the Home Drop Down --> Administration --> Users and access --> Service accounts

Create a user if one doesn;t exist

Then add service account token

Log in to your Grafana dashboard as an admin user
Go to Configuration (gear icon) â†’ API Keys
Click "Add API key"
Provide the following information:

Name: A descriptive name like "vLLM Dashboard Generator"
Role: Select "Admin" if you need to create dashboards
Time to live: Choose how long the key should be valid (or leave blank for no expiration)


Click "Add"
Important: Copy the API key immediately as it will only be shown once


### Reset prom metrics
Enable the admin web-api:
(you have to edit the prom deployment as needed)
- --web.enable-admin-api

curl -X POST -g 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series?match[]={__name__=~".*"}'


If you need to re-install prom for some reason:

```bash
helm upgrade my-prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus \
  --reuse-values
```
