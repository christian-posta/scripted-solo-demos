## RBAC Example

This example shows how to use the mcp-proxy to perform MCP native RBAC.

### Running the example

```bash
cargo run -- -f examples/rbac/config.json
```

Let's look at the config to understand what's going on. First off we have a listener, which tells the proxy how to listen for incoming requests/connections. In this case we're using the `sse` listener, which is a simple HTTP listener that listens on port 3000. In addition we have a JWT authentication section, which tells the proxy how to authenticate the incoming requests. In this case we're using a local JWT public key file to authenticate the incoming requests.
```json
  "listener": {
    "sse": {
      "host": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 3000,
      "authn": {
        "jwt": {
          "issuer": ["me"],
          "audience": ["me.com"],
          "jwks": {
            "local": {
              "file": "manifests/jwt/pub-key"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

Next we have a policies section, which tells the proxy how to authorize the incoming requests. In this case we're using a static policy, which is a list of policies that are applied to the incoming requests.
```json
  "policies": [
    {
      "key": "sub",
      "value": "me",
      "resource": {
        "tool": {
          "id": "everything:echo"
        }
      },
      "matcher": {
        "equals": {}
      }
    }
  ]
```

Finally we have a targets section, which tells the proxy how to proxy the incoming requests to the target. In this case we're proxying to the [Everything](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/everything) server.
```json
  "targets": [
    {
      "name": "everything",
      "stdio": {
        "cmd": "npx",
        "args": [
          "@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
```

Now that we have the proxy running, we can use the [mcpinspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) to try it out.
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Now that we have the inspector running, let's connect to the proxy, for this tutorial we'll need to use a JWT token. If we try without we will get an error.

Now that we're connected, let's try out the echo tool.

![Echo](./img/echo.png)

That worked because we have access to it via the policy. Let's try out the addPet tool.

That didn't work because we don't have access to it via the policy.
