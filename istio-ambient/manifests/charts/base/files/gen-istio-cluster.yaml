          the state of the GatewayClass at the time it was created and changes to
          the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not propagated down to existing
          Gateways. This recommendation is intended to limit the blast radius of changes
          to GatewayClass or associated parameters. If implementations choose to propagate
          GatewayClass changes to existing Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented
          by the implementation. \n Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass,
          implementations MUST add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io`
          finalizer on the associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass

                  must have a unique combination of Hostname, Port, and Protocol.
                  \n An implementation MAY group Listeners by Port and then collapse
                  each group of Listeners into a single Listener if the implementation
                  determines that the Listeners in the group are \"compatible\". An
                  implementation MAY also group together and collapse compatible Listeners
                  belonging to different Gateways. \n For example, an implementation
                  might consider Listeners to be compatible with each other if all
                  of the following conditions are met: \n 1. Either each Listener
                  within the group specifies the \"HTTP\"    Protocol or each Listener
                  within the group specifies either    the \"HTTPS\" or \"TLS\" Protocol.
                  \n 2. Each Listener within the group specifies a Hostname that is
                  unique    within the group. \n 3. As a special case, one Listener
                  within a group may omit Hostname,    in which case this Listener
                  matches when no other Listener    matches. \n If the implementation
                  does collapse compatible Listeners, the hostname provided in the
                  incoming client request MUST be matched to a Listener to find the
                  correct set of Routes. The incoming hostname MUST be matched using
                  the Hostname field for each Listener in order of most to least specific.
                  That is, exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches.
                  \n If this field specifies multiple Listeners that have the same
                  Port value but are not compatible, the implementation must raise
                  a \"Conflicted\" condition in the Listener status. \n Support: Core"

                  2 notable exceptions: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname may
                  be prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard    label

                  by both the Listener and HTTPRoute, there must be at least one intersecting
                  hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:
                  \n * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches
                  HTTPRoutes   that have either not specified any hostnames, or have
                  specified at   least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.

                  \  that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified
                  at least   one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For

                  On the other   hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would
                  not match. \n If both the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified
                  hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames that do not match the Listener
                  hostname MUST be ignored. For example, if a Listener specified `*.example.com`,
                  and the HTTPRoute specified `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`,
                  `test.example.net` must not be considered for a match. \n If both
                  the Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, and none match
                  with the criteria above, then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The
